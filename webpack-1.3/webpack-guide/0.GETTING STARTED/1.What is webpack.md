# WHAT IS WEBPACK ( webpack是什么 )

*webpack* is *moudle bundler*.

_*webpack*是一个*模块打包器*._

webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

_webpack接受具有依赖关系的模块,并生成表示这些模块的静态资产._

## Why another moudle bundler? (为什么另做一个模块打包器)

Existing module bundlers are not well suited for big projects (big single page applications). The most pressing reason for developing another module bundler was [Code Splitting](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html) and that static assets should fit seamlessly together through modularization.

_现有的模块打包器不能很好的适应大型项目(大型单页应用).开发另一个模块打包器的最迫切原因是代码拆分,以及应该将静态资产通过模块化无缝地融合在一起._

I tried to extend existing module bundlers, but it wasn’t possible to achieve all goals.

_我尝试去扩展现有的模块打包器,但是不可能实现所有的目标._

## Goals (目标)
* Split the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
* Keep initial loading time low
* Every static asset should be able to be a module
* Ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries as modules
* Ability to customize nearly every part of the module bundler
* Suited for big projects


* _将依赖关系树拆分为一个个按需加载的块_
* _降低首次访问的时间_
* _每个静态资产都可以作为一个模块_
* _能够将第三方库集成为一个模块_
* _能够定制模块打包器的几乎所有部分_
* _适应大型项目_


## How is webpack different? (webpack如何不同?)

### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)

webpack has two types of dependencies in its dependency tree: sync and async.

Async dependencies act as split points and form a new chunk. After the chunk tree is optimized, a file is emitted for each chunk.

Read more about [Code Splitting](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html).

_webpack在依赖树中有两种依赖类型:同步依赖的和异步依赖._

_异步依赖充当代码切割点并形成一个新的块.在块树优化结束之后,将为每个块生成一个文件._

### [Loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html)

webpack can only process JavaScript natively, but loaders are used to transform other resources into JavaScript. By doing so, every resource forms a module.

Read more about [Using loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html) and [Loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html).

_webpack仅能处理原生的Javascript,但通过加载器可以将其他资源转换为Javascript.通过这样做之后,任何资源形式都能作为一个模块引入到系统中._

### Clever parsing

webpack has a clever parser that can process nearly every 3rd party library. It even allows expressions in dependencies like so require("./templates/" + name + ".jade"). It handles the most common module styles: [CommonJs](https://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) and [AMD](https://webpack.github.io/docs/amd.html)..

_webpack有一个能处理几乎所有第三方库的解析器.它甚至允许在依赖中添加类似It even allows expressions in dependencies like so 'require("./templates/" + name + ".jade").'的表达式.它能处理大部分通用模块模型:CommonJS和AMD._

### [Plugin system](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html)

webpack features a rich plugin system. Most internal features are based on this plugin system. This allows you to customize webpack for your needs and distribute common plugins as open source.

_webpack具有一个丰富的插件系统.大部分内部特性都是基于这个插件系统的.插件系统允许你为了个性需求去定制化webpack以及发布作为开源项目的公共插件._
